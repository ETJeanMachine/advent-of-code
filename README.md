This is a monorepo containing my code solutions for every years [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), dating back to 2015. This is something I began putting together in 2025 mostly out of boredom and an attempt to challenge myself by going back at these old problems and having a stab at them. I will also update this repository with future advent of codes in addition to working on previous year's ones.

## Running Solutions

- 2015: [Read the Instructions](2015/README.md) (Python)
- 2022: [Read the Instructions](2022/README.md) (Python)
- 2024: [Read the Instructions](2024/README.md) (Rust)

## Progress
- 2015: 42 Stars
- 2022: 27 Stars
  - 2022's day's one through fourteen part one were done privately in 2022; and then imported and refactored to fit to this repository.
- 2024: 6 Stars
